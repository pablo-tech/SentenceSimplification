# Sentence Simplification AI for Dyslexic People
Dyslexia impacts about 20% of the worldâ€™s population. We envision a future in which AI allows people to overcome this learning disability. It can be devastating, 48% of prisoners are dyslexic, according to a study by the University of Texas Medical Branch in conjunction with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Dyslexia is a general term for disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols, but that do not affect general intelligence. We have developed a strong intuition for a partial solution to their disorder: sentence simplification Natural Nanguage understanding+processing+generation. This task consists of modifying the content and structure of a text in order to make it easier to read and understand, while preserving its main idea and approximating its original meaning. A simplified version of a text could benefit low literacy readers, in every language, children and adults alike, for people with aphasia, autism, not just dyslexia. In addition, simplifying a text automatically could improve the performance of other NLP tasks, such as parsing, summarization, information extraction, semantic role labeling, and machine translation.
