Sentence Simplification for Dyslexic People

## Insight
Dyslexia impacts about 20% of the worldâ€™s population. We envision a future in which AI allows people to overcome this learning disability. It can be devastating, 48% of prisoners are dyslexic, according to a study by the University of Texas Medical Branch in conjunction with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Dyslexia is a general term for disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols, but that do not affect general intelligence. In my years raising Alec and Chloe, I have developed a strong intuition for a partial solution to their disorder: sentence simplification natural language processing (NLP). This task consists of modifying the content and structure of a text in order to make it easier to read and understand, while preserving its main idea and approximating its original meaning. A simplified version of a text could benefit low literacy readers, in every language, children and adults alike, for people with aphasia, autism, not just dyslexia. In addition, simplifying a text automatically could improve the performance of other NLP tasks, such as parsing, summarisation, information extraction, semantic role labeling, and machine translation.
